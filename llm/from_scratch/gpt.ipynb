    "Multiple inputs (x) are amplified or attenuated (product) by the synaptic weights (w) before being combined (summed) inside the cell body. The cell itself has a bias (b) that gets added to that resulting signal. This signal is then passed through an activation function (f) to determine if the signal will be passed on to other neurons (output). Activation functions in neural networks introduce non-linearity, enabling the network to learn complex patterns. Common activation functions include ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, and Softmax. The hyperbolic tangent (`tanh()`) provides a zero-centered output and smooth gradient and is often used in hidden layers of a neural net. Softmax is often used in the output layer of a neural net.\n",

    "#### 1. Forward Propagation\n",
    "- Input data is fed into the input layer.\n",
    "- The data is then passed through each layer, from input to hidden to output.\n",
    "- At each neuron, the input data is multiplied by the corresponding weights, added to the bias, and passed through the activation function to produce the output: $ z = W \\cdot x + b $\n",
    "\n",
    "- This process continues until the data reaches the output layer, producing the final output of the network.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Compute Loss\n",
    "- After froward propagation, the loss is calculated to deterimne the accuracy of the current prediction.\n",
    "- The _loss function_ measures the difference between the predicted output and the desired target values.\n",
    "- Common loss functions include Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks and Cross-Entropy Loss for classification tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Backpropagation\n",
    "- Once the loss is knows, backpropagation is performed to adjust the weights and biases to minimize the loss.\n",
    "- This is perfomred by calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to each weight and bias using the chain rule.\n",
    "- The gradients are then used to update the weights and biases in the opposite direction of the gradient, a process known as _gradient descent_.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Repeat\n",
    "- Forward propagation and backpropagation will be performed over many iterations, adjusting the weights and biases each time to minimize the loss.\n",
    "- Training continues until the loss converges to a minimum value or a specified number of iterations (epochs) is reached.\n"

    "Building upon the biological and mathematical representation of the neuron, the Transformer architecture has emerged as a game-changer in the field of natural language processing. The transformer has given rise to the GenAI movement, a new era of artificial intelligence that is transforming industries and redefining the boundaries of human-machine collaboration.\n",

    "The Transformer architecture was first introduced in the groundbreaking paper \"[Attention is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762v1)\" by Vaswani et al. in 2017. This seminal work proposed a novel approach to sequence-to-sequence learning, which revolutionized the field of natural language processing (NLP) and beyond. The authors challenged the traditional encoder-decoder architecture, which relied on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process sequential data. Instead, they proposed a purely attention-based model, where the encoder and decoder are composed of identical layers, and the attention mechanism is used to weigh the importance of different input elements when computing the output.\n",

    "\n",
    "The Transformer architecture relies on self-attention, a mechanism that allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence simultaneously and weigh their importance. This is achieved through a series of linear transformations, which compute the attention weights, and a softmax function, which normalizes these weights to ensure they sum to 1. The attention weights are then used to compute the weighted sum of the input elements, which is used as input to the next layer. This process is repeated multiple times, allowing the model to capture long-range dependencies and contextual relationships in the input sequence. The Transformer architecture has since become a cornerstone of modern NLP, and its variants have been applied to a wide range of tasks, including machine translation, text classification, and question answering.\n",
