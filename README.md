# ProtosAI

A Study in Artificial Intelligence

This project consist of a collection of scripts that explore capabilities provided by neural networks pre-trained transformers. These scripts are based on the Hugging Face (https://huggingface.co/) models.  

## Setup

Setup required for these scripts:

```bash
# Requirements
pip install transformers datasets
pip install torch
```

Note that during the fist run, the library will download the required model to process the inputs.

## Sentiment Analysis

The `sentiment.py` script prompts the user for a line of text and uses a model to determine the sentiment of the text (positive, neutral or negative).

```text
Enter some text (or empty to end): I love you.
Sentiment score: [{'label': 'positive', 'score': 0.9286843538284302}]

Enter some text (or empty to end): I am sad.
Sentiment score: [{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.7978498935699463}]

Enter some text (or empty to end): I hate dirty pots.
Sentiment score: [{'label': 'negative', 'score': 0.9309694170951843}]

Enter some text (or empty to end): Don't move!
Sentiment score: [{'label': 'neutral', 'score': 0.6040788292884827}]
```

## Summarization

The `summary.py` script takes a text file input and uses the summarization model to produce a single paragraph summary.

```text
$ python3 summary.py pottery.txt                                     
Loading transformer...

Reading pottery.txt...
Number of lines: 14
Number of words: 566
Number of characters: 3416

Text:  The key to becoming a great artist, writer, musician, etc., is to keep creating!
Keep drawing, keep writing, keep playing! Quality emerges from the quantity of practice
and continuous learning that makes them more perfect . The prize of perfection comes by
delivering and learning, says Jason Cox .

## Transcribe

The `transcribe.py` script takes an audio file (mp3 or wav file) and uses a speech model to produce a basic text transcription. A additional tool `record.py` will use your laptops microphone to record your dictation into `audio.wav` that can be used by `transcribe.py`.

```bash
# Requirements
brew install ffmpeg           
```

```text
$ python3 transcribe.py test.wav

Loading model...

Transcribing test.wav...
HELLO THIS IS A TEST
```

## Text to Speech

The `speech.py` script converts a text string into an audio file.  The script requires additional libraries:

```bash
# Requirements
brew install portaudio  # MacOS requires portaudio
pip install espnet torchaudio sentencepiece pyaudio
```

```text
$ python3 speech.py

Speaking: Perfection is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.

## Handwriting to Text

The `handwriting.py` script converts an image of a handwritten single line of text to a string of text.

```bash
# Requirements
pip install image
```

![test.png](test.png)

```text
$ python3 handwriting.py test.png
Converting image to text: test.png

Loading transformer...
 * microsoft/trocr-base-handwritten

Analyzing handwriting from test.png...

Resulting text:
This is a test-Can you read this?
```

## OpenAI Test

The openai.py script prompts the OpenAI gpt-3.5 model and prints the response.

```bash
# Requirements
pip install openai

# Test
$ python3 gpt.py

## GPT-2 Text Generation

The `gpt-2.py` script uses the gpt2-xl model to generate test based on a prompt.

```bash
$ python3 gpt-2.py   
```

```json
[{'generated_text': "Hello, I'm a language model, but what I do you need to know isn't that hard. But if you want to understand us, you"}, {'generated_text': "Hello, I'm a language model, this is my first commit and I'd like to get some feedback to see if I understand this commit.\n"}, {'generated_text': "Hello, I'm a language model, and I'll guide you on your journey!\n\nLet's get to it.\n\nBefore we start"}, {'generated_text': 'Hello, I\'m a language model, not a developer." If everything you\'re learning about code is through books, you\'ll never get to know about'}, {'generated_text': 'Hello, I\'m a language model, please tell me what you think!" â€“ I started out on this track, and now I am doing a lot'}]
```
